In this study, an automated detection of kidney stones using coronal computed tomography (CT) images was proposed with deep learning (DL) technique which has made significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. A total of 1,7999 images were used by taking different cross-sectional CT images for each person. Our developed automated model showed an accuracy of 96.82% using CT images in detecting the kidney stones.
